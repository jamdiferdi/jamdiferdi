"Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie DiFerdinando. Iâ€™m transitioning into business analytics, drawing on my experience in the service industry. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to drive decisions and have recently developed skills in SQL and Tableau for data visualization and analysis. While I'm new to this field, my strengths in analytical listening, problem-solving, and strategic thinking will help me tackle challenges effectively. Iâ€™m eager to collaborate with teams and apply my project coordination and relationship management skills to create impactful data-driven strategies. Iâ€™d love to connect and discuss how I can bring a fresh perspective to your team!"
This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written.
